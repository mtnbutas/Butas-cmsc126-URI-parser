# Exercise 1 - URL Parsing

## Instructions
The goal is make a page that accepts a URI and identifies the different parts of the given URI (scheme, authority, etc).
You are given the files `index.html` and `parser.js`. The file `parser.js` is incomplete and your task to
fill the missing code to make the URI parser work. The file `parser.js` is loaded in `index.html` so if you want
to check if your code produces the right results just open `index.html` in your browser.
